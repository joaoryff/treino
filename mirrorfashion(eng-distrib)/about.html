<p>
The foundation in 1932 occurred at the time of the economic discovery of the interior of São Paulo. The
<em>Telho family</em>, traditional in the region, invested all their economies in this new initiative,
revolutionary for the time. Founder <em>Eduardo Simões Telho</em>, with a particular vision
has guided the company's business for over 50 years, many of them alongside
of his son <em>E. S. Telho Filho</em>, current CEO. The company name is inspired by the family name.
</p>
<p>
The company's growth was virtually instantaneous. In the first 5 years, it already served 18 countries.
It hit the mark of 100 countries in just 15 years of existence. To date, it has served 740 million
from different users, in billions of different orders.
</p>
<p>
The growth in headcount is also staggering. Today, it is the largest employer in Brazil, but even after 
only 5 years of its existence, already had 30 thousand employees. Out of Brazil, there are 240,000 employees, in addition to the 890,000 Brazilians at Jacarezinho and
in offices across the country.

Given the economic importance of the company to Brazil, the Telho family has already received several awards,
honors and decorations. All Brazilian presidents have visited Mirror's facilities
